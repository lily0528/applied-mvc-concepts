1 - Introduce a new table named KillHistory. The purpose of this table is to create a history every time a monster has been killed. The table should contain the following fields:
Id, MonsterId, Date (including time)

2 - Create a relationship between Monsters and KillHistory (one-to-many; One monster can have many histories and one history belongs to one monster)

3 - Populate some records in this table according to the monsters that you currently have.

4 - Write a SQL query to display all monsters and the number of times they were killed.
