==========================

Create an ASP.NET MVC application to allow the user to maintain a databaseish*(NOT YET!) of movies:

1 - Allow the user to register movies. They should contain the following information:
- Id
- Name
- Rating
- Category

The ID should be auto generated by the application. You can use GUID's or ints.

The rating should be displayed as radio buttons from 1-5.

The categories should be displayed in a select element. Categories can include: 
- Drama
- Comedy
- Horror
- Romance
- Sci-Fi
- Adventure

You can add more categories if you like.

The UI can look something like this: https://imgur.com/a/tgSaKTg

Movie names should be unique!

2 - Display the list of current movies that the user has registered.

3 - Allow the user to edit movies.

4 - Allow the user to delete movies.

* A static list should be used as a database at this point.
